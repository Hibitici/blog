//what we want to do is make variables and clases in the variables 

//  we use clases because classes are isolated code from everything else witch makes it easyer to move them arround 
// classes are a way to view your code in a more intuitive, real-world way. (You package the data and all possible operations on that data together) 


// within the personal object we will be able to store all our information  in our variable

// and the reason we refactorf our code and improve the way it looks and make it easyer to maintain

//we erased our old database because we dont need it anymore we have stored all of our files in cinfig.php so we dont need our database
